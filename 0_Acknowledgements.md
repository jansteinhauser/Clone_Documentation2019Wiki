2019 version:

The FABLE Calculator has been developed thanks to the financial support from the Swedish Postcode Lottery Foundation (Svenska Postkod Stiftelsen). We are grateful for the scrutiny of the FABLE Consortium members who have identified many errors and problems while experimenting with the preliminary versions of the tool. In particular, we would like to thank Federico Carlos Frank, Grace Wu, Nicholas Leach, Raymundo Marcos Martinez, Javi Navarro Garcia, Janne Rämö, Charlotte Gonzalez, Gordon McGord, Felicitas Beier, Rudolf Neubauer, Anton Strokov, Xinpeng Jin, Chandan Jha, Wanderson Costa, Habiburrachman A H F, Gito Immanuel, Kiflu Gedefe Molla, Ginni Braich, Jordan Poncet, Marine Formentini, Frank Sperling, Deniz Koca, Fidèle Niyitanga, Jasmin Irisha Jim Ilham, Armando Sarmiento Lopez, and Firew Bekele Woldeyes for their feedback and their patience with the implementation of the numerous update packages. We are also grateful for the careful review of the documentation from Jordan Poncet.
