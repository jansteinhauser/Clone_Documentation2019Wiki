The main food indicator is the average calorie consumption per capita per day (kcal/cap/day). We also compute proteins and fats consumption in grams per capita per day. We start from the feasible total consumption for each product [(cf. Feasible consumption)](https://github.com/FableCalculator/DocumentationWiki/wiki/3_5.-Feasible-production,-trade,-and-consumption), we multiply it by the share of the total consumption which is for food, we subtract food waste at the household level, we divide by the population number to get the average per capita consumption and by the number of days per year to get the average daily consumption [(cf. Human demand)](https://github.com/FableCalculator/DocumentationWiki/wiki/3_1.-Human-Demand#31-human-demand). Finally, we multiply the average daily consumption per capita by the calorie content of each product. Kilocalories, protein, and fat content per product per country is taken from the FAO Food Balance Sheets (FBS) for the year 2000.

In the FABLE Calculator, the main results related to food are presented in the FOOD worksheet. In the first figure (Figure 8), we display the evolution of the total kcal/cap/day both for the targeted and the feasible levels. A difference between the targeted and the feasible food consumption can be due to two reasons: there is not enough land available or production is not represented for some of the products included in the demand [(cf. Appendix 1)](https://github.com/FableCalculator/DocumentationWiki/wiki/7_1-Appendix-1) because there is no data on production in the FABLE Calculator. In this case, a lower feasible consumption than the targeted consumption should be observed for the historical period. If the gap between the targeted and the feasible consumption increases over time, the missing products on the production side are expected to represent a larger share of total consumption and/or the targeted production cannot be met because of land constraints (cf. [Land scenarios](https://github.com/FableCalculator/DocumentationWiki/wiki/2_Scenarios#27-land-availability) and [Land calculation](https://github.com/FableCalculator/DocumentationWiki/wiki/3_4.-Land#34-land)).

We compare our results with the historical consumption level according to FAO and the Minimum Daily Energy Requirement (MDER). The historical consumption level can be lower than the reported kcal/cap/day from the FAO database because it does not include animal fat and alcohol which are not represented in the FABLE Calculator. The targeted consumption should be equal to the FAO consumption for the historical years.

The daily MDER is computed following FAO guidelines (Cafiero, 2014) using data on the structure of the population by age, class, and sex and the dietary recommendations by age, class, and sex for a certain level of activity. The average MDER at the national level is the sum of the minimum daily energy requirements by population group multiplied by the population number in each group (“age-bracket”) divided by the total population number. Because the population number can also depend on a separate growth scenario determined by the user, the number of people in each age-bracket is scaled accordingly. Scaling of populations in age-brackets is simple and linear, meaning that there is no effect on the population age structure across age-brackets (i.e. selecting different population growth scenarios in the default Calculator changes only the number of individuals represented in each age-bracket, not the structure across age-brackets). The dietary requirements are taken from the Institute of Medicine of Washington (DC) for three different activity levels, low, medium, high (Institute of Medecine, 2002), and the population structure is taken from the UN medium estimate scenario (UN-DESA Population Division, 2017). The user is free to select the level of preferred activity as part of the scenario selection. An average feasible consumption level below, or just at, the MDER level could be worrying as it would mean that each individual in a given country would have just enough food to cover the minimum requirements of the whole population if the available food were perfectly shared across the population.

The second figure of the FOOD worksheet presents the average daily kilocalorie consumption per capita per food group (Figure 9). The correspondence between product and food groups is presented in [Appendix 1](https://github.com/FableCalculator/DocumentationWiki/wiki/7_1-Appendix-1). The results are presented for the feasible consumption only. The comparison between the computed feasible consumption by food group and the historical data from the FAO can help identify where a large gap between the computed and the historical consumption could come from and facilitate the debugging of the Calculator.
