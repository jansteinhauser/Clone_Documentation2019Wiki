# 4 Results indicators

In a final step, the Calculator computes key indicators using as an input the feasible variables computed during the last steps. These include daily kilocalorie consumption per capita; greenhouse gas emissions from land-use change and agriculture; and the share of total land area used for biodiversity conservation. Other available indicators include water footprint and species loss. This list of computed indicators will be expanded in the future.
